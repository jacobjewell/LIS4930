**Welcome** to my *Markdown file*

One of my early discoveries in Markdown was how to link to external sites. For instance, here is a [link to my blog for this class!](http://jacobs6.home.blog/2019/04/01/module-12-r-markdown/)

Another technique I learned was how to do block quotes. 

George Washington is quoted as saying:
> It is better to offer 
> no excuse than a bad one.

While these are interesting techniques, perhaps my most favorite so far is the ability to create a table.

City | Population
------------ | -------------
New York City | 8,622,698
Los Angeles | 3,999,759
Chicago | 2,716,450

I'm excited to see where markdown can take my coding on GitHub.
